This repository showcases the seamless integration of the **[UiPath Platform](https://www.uipath.com/)** with the [**Desktop Outlook Application**](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/outlook/outlook-for-windows), demonstrating how automation can **streamline email operations**. The UiPath RPA robot is designed to **automatically retrieve and save the 10 most recent unread email messages, along with attachments, from the Desktop Outlook App onto your local machine**. Additionally, it **sends an automation report to specified recipients**, keeping them informed about the mailing activities that have taken place. This project demonstrates how UiPath can be harnessed to improve email management and efficiency.
